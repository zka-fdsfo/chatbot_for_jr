# System Architecture

# AI Customer Engagement Platform

## 1. Architecture Goals

The platform must be:

- Modular
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Testable
- Secure
- Extensible
- AI-first
- Production Ready

Business logic must remain independent from frameworks and infrastructure.

---

# 2. Architectural Principles

The application follows:

- Feature-Based Modular Architecture (Vertical Slice)
- Clean Architecture
- SOLID Principles
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer Pattern
- Dependency Inversion
- Separation of Concerns
- Single Responsibility Principle

Every feature should be implemented as an independent module.

# 3. High-Level Architecture

# 4. Backend Folder Structure

```
src/

config/
middleware/
shared/
socket/
utils/

modules/

    auth/

    chat/

    ai/

    knowledge/

    executive/

    admin/

    ticket/

    analytics/

    settings/
```

The project is organized around business features rather than technical layers.

---

# 5. Module Structure

Every module must follow the same internal structure.

```
module/

controller/

service/

repository/

model/

validator/

dto/

routes/

types/
```

Optional folders

```
mapper/

constants/

utils/

interfaces/
```

Each module owns its own implementation.

---

# 6. Shared Layer

Reusable code belongs inside the shared directory.

```
shared/

database/

errors/

responses/

middlewares/

constants/

logger/

types/

validators/

helpers/
```

Nothing in shared should contain business logic.

---

# 7. Module Ownership

## Auth

Owns

- Authentication
- JWT
- Roles
- Password Security

---

## Visitor

Owns

- Visitor Sessions
- Anonymous Users
- Visitor Profiles

---

## Chat

Owns

- Conversations
- Messages
- Typing Indicators
- Read Receipts
- Attachments (future)

---

## AI

Owns

- Prompt Builder
- Intent Detection
- Groq Provider

Only relevant knowledge should be sent to the LLM.

---

# 12. Socket Architecture

Socket.io is infrastructure.

It is not a business module.

Socket is responsible for:

- Connection
- Rooms
- Events
- Presence
- Typing
- Read Receipts
- Notifications

Business logic remains inside Services.

---

# 13. Authentication Flow

```

---

# 14. Error Handling

All errors must use centralized exception handling.

Every API should return the same response format.

Never expose stack traces to clients.

---

# 15. Security Principles

Always implement

- JWT Authentication
- Password Hashing
- Input Validation
- Helmet
- Rate Limiting
- CORS
- Environment Variables

Never hardcode secrets.

---

# 16. AI Design Principles

The AI must

- Answer only from company knowledge
- Never hallucinate
- Never invent pricing
- Detect escalation
- Collect leads naturally
- Generate conversation summaries

The AI provider must be replaceable without changing business logic.

---

# 17. Future Scalability

The architecture must support

- MongoDB Vector Search
- Multiple AI Providers
- Voice Support
- WhatsApp
- Facebook Messenger
- Email
- OCR
- Multi-language
- Workflow Automation

New capabilities should be added as independent modules whenever possible.

---

# 18. Architecture Decision Records

Major architectural decisions must be documented in:

```
docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md
```

Examples

- New module
- Database redesign
- Authentication changes
- AI provider replacement
- New infrastructure

---

# 19. Implementation Rules

Before implementing any feature

1. Identify the owning module.
2. Reuse existing services where appropriate.
3. Avoid duplicate business logic.
4. Keep modules independent.
5. Update documentation after implementation.
6. Maintain backward compatibility.

Every new feature should strengthen the architecture rather than bypass it.

## Continuous Improvement Principles

Future development must preserve the existing architecture.

Do not redesign existing modules unless necessary.

Prefer extending existing services over creating duplicate implementations.

Conversation history must remain the single source of truth.

Executives always continue the existing conversation rather than creating a new one.

Tickets are linked to conversations rather than replacing them.
